| Option                                  | Description |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| -i, \--tablespace-index=TABLESPC        | Store all indexes in a separate PostgreSQL tablespace named by this parameter. This allows one to e.g. store the indexes on faster storage like SSDs. This option affects the middle as well as the pgsql output indexes. *Version >= 1.11.0*{:.version} This option is deprecated, use `--tablespace-main-index` and/or `--tablespace-slim-index` instead. |
| \--tablespace-slim-data=TABLESPC        | Store the slim mode tables in the given tablespace. |
| \--tablespace-slim-index=TABLESPC       | Store the indexes of the slim mode tables in the given tablespace. |
| -p, \--prefix=PREFIX                    | Prefix for table names (default: `planet_osm`). This option affects the middle as well as the pgsql output table names. *Version >= 1.9.0*{: .version} You don't need to add this option any more in append mode, because osm2pgsql will remember it from the import. |
| -s, \--slim                             | Store temporary data in the database. Without this mode, all temporary data is stored in RAM. If you do not have enough memory, the import will not work successfully. With slim mode, you can import the data even on a system with limited RAM, albeit much slower. Slim mode is also needed if you want to update your database later. |
| \--drop                                 | Drop the slim mode tables from the database and remove the flat nodes file once the import is complete. This can greatly reduce the size of the database, as the slim mode tables typically are the same size, if not slightly bigger than the main tables. It does not, however, reduce the maximum spike of disk usage during import. It can furthermore increase the import speed, as no indexes need to be created for the slim mode tables, which (depending on hardware) can nearly halve import time. Slim mode tables however have to be persistent if you want to be able to update your database, as these tables are needed for diff processing.
| -C NUM, \--cache=NUM                    | Ignored in non-slim mode. In slim mode: Use up to **NUM** MB of RAM for caching nodes. Giving osm2pgsql sufficient cache to store all imported nodes typically greatly increases the speed of the import. Default: 800 (MB). |
| \--cache-strategy=STRATEGY              | *Version < 1.5.0*{:.version} There are a number of different modes in which osm2pgsql can organize its node cache in RAM. These are optimized for different assumptions of the data and the hardware resources available. Currently available strategies are **dense**, **chunked**, **sparse** and **optimized**. **dense** assumes that the node id numbers are densely packed, i.e. only a few IDs in the range are missing / deleted. For planet extracts this is usually not the case, making the cache very inefficient and wasteful of RAM. **sparse** assumes node IDs in the data are not densely packed, greatly increasing caching efficiency in these cases. If node IDs are densely packed, like in the full planet, this strategy has a higher overhead for indexing the cache. **optimized** uses both dense and sparse strategies for different ranges of the ID space. On a block by block basis it tries to determine if it is more effective to store the block of IDs in sparse or dense mode. This is the default and should be typically used. |
| \--cache-strategy=STRATEGY              | *Version >= 1.5.0*{:.version} The option has been removed and only a warning is printed. |
| -x, \--extra-attributes                 | Include attributes of each object in the middle tables and make them available to the outputs. Attributes are: user name, user id, changeset id, timestamp and version. *Version >= 1.9.0*{: .version} You don't need to add this option any more in append mode, because osm2pgsql will remember it from the import. |
| \--flat-nodes=FILENAME                  | The flat-nodes mode is a separate method to store slim mode node information on disk. Instead of storing this information in the main PostgreSQL database, this mode creates its own separate custom database to store the information. Storage is much more efficient. Storing the node information for the full planet requires hundreds of GBytes in PostgreSQL, the same data is stored in "only" 80GB using the flat-nodes mode. This can also increase the speed of applying diff files. This option activates the flat-nodes mode and specifies the location of the database file. It is a single large file. This mode is only recommended for imports of the full planet or very large extracts. The default is disabled. *Version >= 1.9.0*{: .version} You don't need to add this option any more in append mode, because osm2pgsql will remember it from the import. If you set it in append mode anyway, it will use the new setting for this and future updates. |
| \--middle-schema=SCHEMA                 | *Version >= 1.4.0*{:.version} Use PostgreSQL schema SCHEMA for all tables, indexes, and functions in the middle. The schema must exist in the database and be writable by the database user. *Version < 1.9.0*{:.version} By default no schema is set which usually means the tables will be created in the `public` schema. *Version >= 1.9.0*{:.version} By default the schema set with `--schema` is used, or `public` if that is not set. |
| \--middle-way-node-index-id-shift SHIFT | *Version >= 1.4.0*{:.version} Set ID shift for way node bucket index in middle. Experts only. See [Bucket Index for slim mode](#bucket-index-for-slim-mode) for details. |
| \--middle-database-format=FORMAT        | *Version >= 1.9.0*{:.version} Set the database format for the middle tables to FORMAT. Allowed formats are `legacy` and `new`. See [the Database structure section in the Middle chapter](#database-structure) for details. Only works with `--slim`. In append mode osm2pgsql will automatically detect the database format, so don't use this with `-a, --append`.)
| \--middle-with-nodes                    | *Version >= 1.9.0*{:.version} Used together with the `new` middle database format. Usually nodes are only stored in the database when no flat nodes file is used. When a flat node file is used and you still want tagged nodes (and only those) in the database, use this option. |
