| Option                                  | Description |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| \--tablespace-slim-data=TABLESPC        | Store the slim mode tables in the given tablespace. |
| \--tablespace-slim-index=TABLESPC       | Store the indexes of the slim mode tables in the given tablespace. |
| -p, \--prefix=PREFIX                    | Prefix for table names (default: `planet_osm`). This option affects the middle as well as the pgsql output table names. You don't need to add this option in append mode, because osm2pgsql will remember it from the import. |
| -s, \--slim                             | Store temporary data in the database. Without this mode, all temporary data is stored in RAM. If you do not have enough memory, the import will not work successfully. With slim mode, you can import the data even on a system with limited RAM, albeit much slower. Slim mode is also needed if you want to update your database later. |
| \--drop                                 | Drop the slim mode tables from the database and remove the flat nodes file once the import is complete. This can greatly reduce the size of the database, as the slim mode tables typically are the same size, if not slightly bigger than the main tables. It does not, however, reduce the maximum spike of disk usage during import. It can furthermore increase the import speed, as no indexes need to be created for the slim mode tables, which (depending on hardware) can nearly halve import time. Slim mode tables however have to be persistent if you want to be able to update your database, as these tables are needed for diff processing.
| -C NUM, \--cache=NUM                    | Ignored in non-slim mode. In slim mode: Use up to **NUM** MB of RAM for caching nodes. Giving osm2pgsql sufficient cache to store all imported nodes typically greatly increases the speed of the import. Default: 800 (MB). |
| -x, \--extra-attributes                 | Include attributes of each object in the middle tables and make them available to the outputs. Attributes are: user name, user id, changeset id, timestamp and version. You don't need to add this option in append mode, because osm2pgsql will remember it from the import. |
| -F FILENAME, \--flat-nodes=FILENAME     | The flat-nodes mode is a separate method to store node locations on disk. Instead of storing this information in RAM or in the main PostgreSQL database, this mode creates its own separate custom database to store the information. Storage is much more efficient. Storing the node information for the full planet requires hundreds of GBytes in PostgreSQL, the same data is stored in "only" 100GB using the flat-nodes mode. This can also increase the speed of applying diff files. This option activates the flat-nodes mode and specifies the location of the database file. It is a single large file. This mode is only recommended for imports of the full planet or very large extracts. The default is disabled. You don't need to add this option in append mode, because osm2pgsql will remember it from the import. If you set it in append mode anyway, it will use the new setting for this and future updates. |
| \--middle-schema=SCHEMA                 | Use PostgreSQL schema SCHEMA for all tables, indexes, and functions in the middle. The schema must exist in the database and be writable by the database user. By default the schema set with `--schema` is used, or `public` if that is not set. |
| \--middle-with-nodes                    | Usually nodes are only stored in the database middle tables when no flat nodes file is used. When a flat node file is used and you still want tagged nodes (and only those) in the database, use this option. |
