# NAME

osm2pgsql - Openstreetmap data to PostgreSQL converter

# SYNOPSIS

**osm2pgsql** \[*OPTIONS*\] OSM-FILE

# DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the **osm2pgsql** command.

**osm2pgsql** imports data from OSM file(s) into a PostgreSQL database
suitable for use by the Mapnik renderer or the Nominatim geocoder.
OSM planet snapshots can be downloaded from
https://planet.openstreetmap.org/. Partial planet files
("extracts") for various countries are available, see
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm.

Extracts in PBF (ProtoBufBinary) format are also available from
https://download.geofabrik.de/.

When operating in "slim" mode (and on a database created in "slim" mode!),
**osm2pgsql** can also process OSM change files (osc files), thereby bringing
an existing database up to date.


# OPTIONS

This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (`--`). A summary of options is included below.

-a, \--append
:   Add the OSM file into the database without removing
    existing data.

-b, \--bbox
:   Apply a bounding box filter on the imported data.
    Must be specified as: minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat
    e.g. **\--bbox** **-0.5,51.25,0.5,51.75**

-c, \--create
:   Remove existing data from the database. This is the
    default if **\--append** is not specified.

-d, \--database name
:   The name of the PostgreSQL database to connect to.

-i, \--tablespace-index tablespacename
:   Store all indices in a separate PostgreSQL tablespace named by this parameter.
    This allows one to e.g. store the indices on faster storage like SSDs.

\--tablespace-main-data tablespacename
:   Store the data tables (non slim) in the given tablespace.

\--tablespace-main-index tablespacename
:   Store the indices of the main tables (non slim) in the given tablespace.

\--tablespace-slim-data tablespacename
:   Store the slim mode tables in the given tablespace.

\--tablespace-slim-index tablespacename
:   Store the indices of the slim mode tables in the given tablespace.

\--latlong
:   Store data in degrees of latitude & longitude.

-m, \--merc
:   Store data in Spherical Mercator (Web Mercator, EPSG:3857) (the default).

-E, \--proj num
:   Use projection EPSG:num.

-p, \--prefix prefix_string
:   Prefix for table names (default: planet_osm).

-r, \--input-reader format
:   Select format of the input file. Available choices are **auto**
    (default) for autodetecting the format,
    **xml** for OSM XML format files, **o5m** for o5m formatted files
    and **pbf** for OSM PBF binary format.

-s, \--slim
:   Store temporary data in the database. Without this mode, all temporary data is stored in
    RAM and if you do not have enough the import will not work successfully. With slim mode,
    you should be able to import the data even on a system with limited RAM, although if you
    do not have enough RAM to cache at least all of the nodes, the time to import the data
    will likely be greatly increased.

\--drop
:   Drop the slim mode tables from the database once the import is complete. This can
    greatly reduce the size of the database, as the slim mode tables typically are the same
    size, if not slightly bigger than the main tables. It does not, however, reduce the
    maximum spike of disk usage during import. It can furthermore increase the import speed,
    as no indices need to be created for the slim mode tables, which (depending on hardware)
    can nearly halve import time. Slim mode tables however have to be persistent if you want
    to be able to update your database, as these tables are needed for diff processing.

-S, \--style /path/to/style
:   Location of the osm2pgsql style file. This specifies which tags from the data get
    imported into database columns and which tags get dropped. Defaults to /usr/share/osm2pgsql/default.style.

-C, \--cache num
:   Only for slim mode: Use up to num many MB of RAM for caching nodes. Giving osm2pgsql sufficient cache
    to store all imported nodes typically greatly increases the speed of the import. Each cached node
    requires 8 bytes of cache, plus about 10% - 30% overhead. As a rule of thumb,
    give a bit more than the size of the import file in PBF format. If the RAM is not
    big enough, use about 75% of memory. Make sure to leave enough RAM for PostgreSQL.
    It needs at least the amount of `shared_buffers` given in its configuration.
    Defaults to 800.

\--cache-strategy strategy
:   There are a number of different modes in which osm2pgsql can organize its
    node cache in RAM. These are optimized for different assumptions of the data
    and the hardware resources available. Currently available strategies are
    **dense**, **chunked**, **sparse** and **optimized**. **dense** assumes
    that the node id numbers are densely packed, i.e. only a few IDs in the range are
    missing / deleted. For planet extracts this is usually not the case, making the cache
    very inefficient and wasteful of RAM. **sparse** assumes node IDs in the data
    are not densely packed, greatly increasing caching efficiency in these cases.
    If node IDs are densely packed, like in the full planet, this strategy has a higher
    overhead for indexing the cache. **optimized** uses both dense and sparse strategies
    for different ranges of the ID space. On a block by block basis it tries to determine
    if it is more effective to store the block of IDs in sparse or dense mode. This is the
    default and should be typically used.

-U, \--username name
:   Postgresql user name.

-W, \--password
:   Force password prompt.

-H, \--host hostname
:   Database server hostname or socket location.

-P, \--port num
:   Database server port.

-e, \--expire-tiles [min_zoom-]max-zoom
:   Create a tile expiry list.

-o, \--expire-output /path/to/expire.list
:   Output file name for expired tiles list.

-O, \--output
:   Specifies the output back-end or database schema to use. Currently osm2pgsql
    supports **pgsql**, **flex**, **gazetteer** and **null**. **pgsql** is
    the default output back-end / schema and is optimized for rendering with Mapnik.
    **gazetteer** is a db schema optimized for geocoding and is used by Nominatim.
    The experimental **flex** backend allows more flexible configuration.
    **null** does not write any output and is only useful for testing or with
    --slim for creating slim tables. There is also a **multi** backend. This is
    now deprecated and will be removed in future versions of osm2pgsql.

-x, \--extra-attributes
:   Include attributes for each object in the database.
    This includes the username, userid, timestamp and version.
    Note: this option also requires additional entries in your style file.

-k, \--hstore
:   Add tags without column to an additional hstore (key/value) column to PostgreSQL tables.

-j, \--hstore-all
:   Add all tags to an additional hstore (key/value) column in PostgreSQL tables.

-z, \--hstore-column key_name
:   Add an additional hstore (key/value) column containing all tags
    that start with the specified string, eg \--hstore-column "name:" will
    produce an extra hstore column that contains all name:xx tags

\--hstore-match-only
:   Only keep objects that have a value in one of the columns
   (normal action with \--hstore is to keep all objects).

\--hstore-add-index
:   Create indices for the hstore columns during import.

-G, \--multi-geometry
:   Normally osm2pgsql splits multi-part geometries into separate database rows per part.
    A single OSM id can therefore have several rows. With this option, PostgreSQL instead
    generates multi-geometry features in the PostgreSQL tables.

-K, \--keep-coastlines
:   Keep coastline data rather than filtering it out.
    By default natural=coastline tagged data will be discarded based on the
    assumption that Shapefiles generated by OSMCoastline (https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/)
    will be used.

\--number-processes num
:   Specifies the number of parallel processes used for certain operations. If disks are
    fast enough e.g. if you have an SSD, then this can greatly increase speed of
    the "going over pending ways" and "going over pending relations" stages on a multi-core
    server.

-I, \--disable-parallel-indexing
:   By default osm2pgsql initiates the index building on all tables in parallel to increase
    performance. This can be disadvantages on slow disks, or if you don't have
    enough RAM for PostgreSQL to perform up to 7 parallel index building processes
    (e.g. because maintenance_work_mem is set high).

\--flat-nodes /path/to/nodes.cache
:   The flat-nodes mode is a separate method to store slim mode node information on disk.
    Instead of storing this information in the main PostgreSQL database, this mode creates
    its own separate custom database to store the information. As this custom database
    has application level knowledge about the data to store and is not general purpose,
    it can store the data much more efficiently. Storing the node information for the full
    planet requires more than 300GB in PostgreSQL, the same data is stored in "only" 50GB using
    the flat-nodes mode. This can also increase the speed of applying diff files. This option
    activates the flat-nodes mode and specifies the location of the database file. It is a
    single large file. This mode is only recommended for full planet imports
    as it doesn't work well with small imports. The default is disabled.

-h, \--help
:   Help information.
    Add **-v** to display supported projections.

-v, \--verbose
:   Verbose output.
