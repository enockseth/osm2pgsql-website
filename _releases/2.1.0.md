title: Version 2.1.0
version: 2.1.0
date: 2025-04-07
manpages:
    - osm2pgsql
    - osm2pgsql-gen
    - osm2pgsql-replication
highlights:
    - Improved compatibility with connection poolers
---

This is a bugfix and maintenance release. The main visible change is that
osm2pgsql now works better together with connection poolers and similar
database middleware: prepared statements now use protocol level prepare instead
of PREPARE sql commands and there is a new option to explicitly create a
primary key on flex tables.

Other fixes and features:

* check flat node file format for forwards compatibility to prepare for future changes of the flatnode file format
* fix two-stage processing when flat node file is used
* fix getting node locations in slim node with two-stage processing
* updated included libosmium, protozero and fmt libraries
