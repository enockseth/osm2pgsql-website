We are happy to announce that osm2pgsql maintainer Sarah has been selected as
one of the fellows for the one-year pilot of the
[Sovereign Tech Fellowship programme](https://www.sovereign.tech/news/meet-the-sovereign-tech-fellows)
of the Sovereign Tech Agency. The programme recognises and financially supports
the significant amount of time that goes into the daily maintenance of an
open-source project. Read more about the fellowship in
[Sarah's post over at nominatim.org](https://nominatim.org/2025/02/06/sovereign-tech-fellowship.html).
