title: Release 2.1.0
---

Today we released version 2.1.0, a bugfix and maintenance release. The main
visible change is that osm2pgsql now works better together with connection
poolers and similar database middleware: prepared statements now use protocol
level prepare instead of `PREPARE` SQL commands and there is a new option to
explicitly create a primary key on flex tables.

Other fixes and features:

* check flat node file format for forwards compatibility to prepare for future changes of the flatnode file format
* fix two-stage processing when flat node file is used
* fix getting node locations in slim node with two-stage processing
* updated included libosmium, protozero and fmt libraries
