Docker images for the latest and many earlier versions of osm2pgsql are
available from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/iboates/osm2pgsql)

```sh
docker pull iboates/osm2pgsql:latest
```

You can then generally run the image by passing the same arguments to `docker
run iboates/osm2pgsql` as you would to `osm2pgsql` itself. It is a little bit
more subtle than that (especially regarding `osm2pgsql-replication`), see the
[readme](https://github.com/iboates/osm-utilities-docker/tree/master/osm2pgsql)
for more info. There are also more examples, including one using `docker
compose`.

Note that these docker images are maintained externally. If you have any
questions or bug reports [contact the
maintainer](https://github.com/iboates/osm-utilities-docker/issues).
