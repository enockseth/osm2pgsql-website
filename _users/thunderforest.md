Thunderforest is a commercial service offering raster and vector maps with
custom styles. Their map stack is based on the flex output of osm2pgsql.

Thunderforest is also the source of the popular OpenCycleMap, which is
available as one of the map choices on www.openstreetmap.org.

Since 2020 Thunderforest supports osm2pgsql. As well as having paid for the
initial development of the "flex output" they also provide monthly sponsorship
for routine maintainance and feature development.
